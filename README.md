# Pro Media Player

## Overview

This is a modern, feature-rich media player project built with HTML5, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It aims to provide a beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly interface for playing local or online audio and video files.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Media Support**: Seamlessly plays both audio (MP3) and video (MP4) files.
- **Dynamic Playlist**: Easily manage and load the media queue via a `playlist.json` file.
- **ID3 Tag Reading**: Automatically extracts cover art, title, and artist information from MP3 files using `jsmediatags`.
- **Dynamic UI Background**: Extracts theme colors from album art to generate a smooth gradient background during audio playback. For video, the video itself acts as the visual background.
- **Synchronized Lyrics**: Supports LRC-formatted lyrics with real-time highlighting of the current line.
- **Modern Player Controls**: Includes all standard controls such as play/pause, next/previous track, progress bar, volume control, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: Delivers an optimized user experience on both desktop browsers and mobile devices.
- **Side Panels**: Separate, slide-out panels for the playlist and lyrics to keep the main view clean and focused.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Library**: [jsmediatags.js](https://github.com/aadsm/jsmediatags) (for reading MP3 metadata)
