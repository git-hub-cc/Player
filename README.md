## Introduction

This is a modern, feature-rich media player project built with HTML5, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. **Its interface design is heavily inspired by Spotify**, aiming to provide a beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly interface for playing local or online audio and video files.

## Main Features

- **Modern UI Design**: The interface is inspired by Spotify, offering a clean and intuitive user experience.
- **Hybrid Media Support**: Seamlessly plays both audio (MP3) and video (MP4) files.
- **Dynamic Playlist**: Easily manage and load a media queue via a `playlist.json` file.
- **ID3 Tag Reading**: Automatically extracts cover art, title, and artist information from MP3 files using `jsmediatags`.
