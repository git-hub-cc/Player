https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33046049-a997-47e6-85e5-f4626889c0f0

## Introduction

This is a modern, feature-rich media player project built with HTML5, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (ES6+). **Its interface is heavily inspired by Spotify**, aiming to provide a beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly interface for playing local or online audio and video files. The project is built without any frontend frameworks (like React or Vue), showcasing the power of native web technologies.

## ‚ú® Feature Highlights

-   **Modern UI Design**: An interface inspired by Spotify, providing a clean and intuitive user experience, complete with a skeleton loading screen to enhance the initial load.
-   **Hybrid Media Support**: Seamlessly play both audio (e.g., MP3) and video (e.g., MP4) files, with the UI automatically adapting to the media type.
-   **Dynamic Playlist**: Easily manage and load your media queue through a simple `playlist.json` file.
-   **Smart Playlist Search**: The playlist panel supports fuzzy search by title, artist, **Pinyin**, or **Pinyin initials**.
-   **ID3 Tag Reading**: Utilizes `jsmediatags` to automatically extract cover art, title, and artist information from MP3 files, minimizing manual configuration.
-   **Dynamic UI Background**: For audio playback, it intelligently extracts dominant colors from the album art to generate a smooth, elegant gradient background. For video playback, the video itself becomes the visual background.
-   **Synchronized Lyrics**: Supports the LRC format for lyrics, which automatically scroll and highlight the current line during playback.
-   **Multiple Play Modes**: Easily switch between List Loop, Single Loop, and Shuffle modes with a single click.
-   **Feature Tour**: First-time visitors are greeted with a guided tour that highlights key features, helping them get started quickly.
-   **Highly Customizable Shortcuts**: A dedicated settings panel allows users to record and modify their own keyboard shortcuts for common actions like play/pause, next track, volume control, and more.
-   **Immersive Mode**: Enter a one-click fullscreen mode for an immersive, distraction-free listening or viewing experience.
-   **Right-Click Context Menu**: Right-click anywhere on the page to quickly access core playback controls.
-   **Fully Responsive Design**: Delivers an optimized layout and interaction experience on both widescreen desktop browsers and mobile devices.
-   **Side Panel System**: Organizes the playlist, "About" information, and shortcut settings into clean, retractable side panels, keeping the main interface uncluttered.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1.  **Clone or Download the Project**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/git-hub-cc/Player.git
    cd Player
    ```

2.  **Set Up Dependencies**
    This project relies on `pinyin-pro` for its advanced Chinese Pinyin search functionality. Please download the library and place it in the `lib` folder.
    -   [pinyin-pro download link](https://github.com/zh-lx/pinyin-pro)
    -   Ensure the file path is `lib/index.min.js`.

3.  **Start a Local Server**
    Due to browser security policies (CORS), opening `index.html` directly via the `file://` protocol may prevent some features (like fetching `playlist.json`) from working. It's recommended to use a simple local server.

    If you have Node.js installed, you can use `http-server` or `live-server`:
    ```bash
    # Install live-server globally (if you haven't already)
    npm install -g live-server
    
    # Run from the project's root directory
    live-server
    ```
    Alternatively, use Python's built-in HTTP server:
    ```bash
    # For Python 3
    python -m http.server
    
    # For Python 2
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    ```
    Then, open the provided address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080`) in your browser.

## üîß How to Configure

### The Playlist (`playlist.json`)
You can manage your media content by editing the `playlist.json` file in the project's root directory. The file is a JSON array, where each object represents a media track.

**Track Object Structure:**

| Key        | Type   | Description                                                                                              | Required |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `title`    | string | The title of the media.                                                                                  | Yes      |
| `artist`   | string | The artist or creator.                                                                                   | Yes      |
| `src`      | string | The path to the media file (relative local path or URL).                                                 | Yes      |
| `type`     | string | The media type, either `'audio'` or `'video'`.                                                           | Yes      |
| `lyrics`   | string | LRC-formatted lyrics text. If left empty, "No lyrics available" will be displayed.                         | No       |
| `albumArt` | string | The URL for the cover art. For audio files, if this is not provided, the system will try to read it from the file's metadata using `jsmediatags`. | No       |

**Example:**
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Song A",
    "artist": "Artist A",
    "src": "media/audio/song_a.mp3",
    "type": "audio",
    "lyrics": "[00:01.00]First line of lyrics\n[00:05.50]Second line of lyrics",
    "albumArt": "media/art/album_a.jpg"
  },
  {
    "title": "Video B",
    "artist": "Creator B",
    "src": "media/video/video_b.mp4",
    "type": "video",
    "lyrics": ""
  }
]
```
